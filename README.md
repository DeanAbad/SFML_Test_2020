# Build

>_**Note:** This is meant to be compiled with VSC._

## Steps
1. Change the `compilerPath` value to the path of your GCC compiler. You can find this property under the `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`.
2. Type and enter 'make' in the CLI.
    - If you don't have make, you can install it with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) first.
3. Now that it's compiled, you may run it with `./SFML_Test_2020` in the CLI.
